    <h2>Christian I. Ahanonu</h2>
    <p>My name is Christian I. Ahanonu, I am from the eastern part of Nigeria and I currently live in Abuja the central captial. I am the second of two boys in my family, we have no girls. I am looking at a successful career as an IT Support Specialist after which I would like to transition to Network Administration. With my learning of HTML and CSS I may likely get my hands around Web Design. It's something I want to do on the side. </p> 
    <p>I love to exercise because its something that I consider important and it helps me be active and productive. I love to sing and dance. And I also enjoy helping people out. Furthermore, I like graphic design and luckly for me I will be learning about HTML and CSS this semester which will give me an insider about web design. Currently, I am not married, I am still single. I plan on getting married pretty soon.</p>
    <p>I currently serve as second counselor in my ward bishopric. I enjoy investing time in helping Heavenly Father bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. I work as a security operative while studing at BYU-Idaho Online. With time I plan on transitioning to IT Support. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for 24 years now and it has been a wonderful experience. I cannot imagine my existence without the gospel of Jesus Christ. I served my mission in Nigeria Lagos Mission and the experience increased my faith, testimony, and improved my ability to serve Heavenly Father and build his kingdom on earth. One of my favorite quotes is from Elder David A. Bednar I cannot remember the exact words however I will paraphrase. He said that the most important work today that we as members can invest time is the work of salvation. It is far more important than any other thing else. These words are true no less, that is my drive for my service in the Lord's vineyard.</p>
    <p>It's great to meet you all in class, I hope to have an exciting learning experience with you guys. </p>
